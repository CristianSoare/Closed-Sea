# Closed-Sea

Search applicationg which takes in an ETH address and returns the NFT assets associated under that address. Closed-Sea is using the OpenSea free API. I have spoken to the team and
am awaiting the API key which will allow me to provide the financial statistics accompanying the NFT's (such as value, latest sale, etc). 

**Features:**

  -Search bar which can be submitted using enter or the magnifying glass. Also is fully response to screen size.
  
  -Website is compatible with all screens ranging from small smart phone screens to large desktop monitors.
  
  -Uses the free version of OpenSea API to provide NFT name, description of NFT on hover of name, and slug of NFT collection.
  
  -Fully responsive website with sleek design.
  
  -Functioning loading spinner state which is loaded whilst API data is fetched.
  
  If anyone would like to test the website's functionality, feel free to use the following ETH address and verify its assets using the website:
  **0x6efb854fb7bcc9cef5bb9be8b542584a836ecf06**
